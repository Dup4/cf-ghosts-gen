# Gym Ghost Participant Generator

This is a project for storing the ghost participants for Codeforces Gym.

- DOMjudge: Run cf-ghosts-dj.php via web with database
- HUSTOJ: Code lost :(
- HDU OJ: Run cf-ghosts-hdoj.py via local computer
- PTA: Code lost :(

If you don't want to run PHPs with web, you can modify several variables, execute it with local command line and get the content from standard output.
