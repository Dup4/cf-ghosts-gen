# Gym Ghost Participant Generator

This is a project for storing the ghost participants for Codeforces Gym.

- DOMjudge: Run `cf-ghosts-dj.php` via web with database
- HUSTOJ: Run `cf-ghosts-hustoj.php` via web with database (not sure whether this is for CCPC modified or not)
- HDU OJ: Run `cf-ghosts-hdoj.py` via local computer
- PTA: Run `cf-ghosts-pta.py` via local computer
- Nowcoder: Reference to `cf-ghosts-nowcoder\README.md`

If you don't want to run PHPs with web, you can modify several variables, execute it with local command line and get the content from standard output.
